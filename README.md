# gml.vim
GameMaker 2 Language syntax file for vim.

I found this on the internet(Ness Morris) but it only supported GML1 syntax. I'm not a pro, so I couldn't do much but I added some missing sytax highlights. I hope this will be useful for others and it'd be good if people improve this.

NOTICE: I'm sorry I forgot that I was sharing this syntax file on git and kept adding my own functions and macros to this syntax file, mostly it shouldn't be much of a problem anyway but saying just in case. I want to clean it up when I can find the motivation and time for it.
